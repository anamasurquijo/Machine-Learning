# Machine-Learning

## 🌍 Project Goal
The purpose of this project is to analyze the daily bike-sharing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and build predictive models that can help a bike-sharing company optimize operations.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **`data/raw`**: Original, unprocessed data  

- **`data/processed`**: Cleaned, merged, and transformed data  

- **`scripts/`**: Modular R scripts containing functions to reuse across analyses  

## ⚙️ How to Start Working

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anamasurquijo/Machine-Learning.git
```

### Make changes and push R scipts + updated data files. 
**Note: DO NOT push the .Rproj file as this will lead to incompatibility between package versions and local system versions**
